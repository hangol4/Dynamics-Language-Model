**The Large Magellanic Cloud is the most massive satellite**
**galaxy of the Milky Way, with an estimated mass exceeding**
**a tenth of the mass of the Milky Way** **[1][–][5]** **. Just past its closest**
**approach of about 50 kpc, and flying past the Milky Way at an**
**astonishing speed of 327 km s** **[−][1]** **(ref.** **[6]** **), the Large Magellanic**
**Cloud can affect our Galaxy in a number of ways, including dis-**
**lodging the Milky Way disk from the Galactic centre of mass** **[7][–]**

**9** **. Here, we report evidence that the Milky Way disk is moving**
**with respect to stellar tracers in the outer halo in a direction**
**that points at an earlier location on the Large Magellanic**
**Cloud trajectory. The resulting reflex motion is detected in the**
**kinematics of outer halo stars and Milky Way satellite galax-**
**ies with accurate distances, proper motions and line-of-sight**
**velocities. Our results indicate that dynamical models of our**
**Galaxy cannot neglect gravitational perturbations induced**
**by the Large Magellanic Cloud infall, nor can observations of**
**the stellar halo be treated in a reference frame that does not**
**correct for disk reflex motion. Future spectroscopic surveys of**
**the stellar halo combined with Gaia astrometry will allow for**
**sophisticated modelling of the Large Magellanic Cloud trajec-**
**tory across the Milky Way, constraining the dark matter dis-**
**tribution in both galaxies with unprecedented detail.**
Numerical simulations that follow the accretion of a massive
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) into our Galaxy predict that the
Milky Way (MW) disk will be displaced with a speed of *v* travel ≈
*v* LMC ( *M* LMC / *M* MW ) relative to the initial Galactic barycentre [7][–][9] . If true,
the disk motion should be detectable in the apparent kinematics of
halo stars with long dynamical times as a simple dipole [9] . The peak
of the blue-shifted velocities, or apex, is the direction towards which
the MW disk is currently travelling. Here, we measure the direction
( *ℓ* apex, *b* apex ) and the magnitude ( *v* travel ) of the disk motion by applying a Bayesian analysis of proper motions and radial velocities of
hundreds of bright, distant stars in the smooth MW stellar halo: K
giants, blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars and the MW satellites,
each with individual 6-dimensional position–velocity information [10][–][13] . Distant tracers have long dynamical times and are thus
slow to react to the gravitational pull of the LMC [9] . Because the MW
disk moves in response to the LMC, but the outer halo does not, a
reflex motion arises as a global kinematic pattern on the sky: the
distant halo appears to move relative to the MW disk, when in fact
it is the MW disk moving relative to the distant halo stars, an effect
akin to the apparent motion of rain drops seen from a car driving
through a downpour.
In Fig. 1, we show the on-sky probability density function for
the direction of the MW disk travel imprinted in the kinematics
of each of the three halo tracers ( *ℓ* apex, *b* apex ), against a backdrop
of RR Lyrae stars [14][–][16] . All three tracers return consistent values at
the 67% confidence level (Table 1). Strikingly, the apex direction is


not pointing towards the present-day location of the LMC on the
sky, but rather along its historical trajectory across the MW. This
implies that, as the LMC approached its current location with great
speed, the MW disk was not able to keep up. As a result, the MW
disk appears to be travelling in the direction of the LMC at some
earlier point on its trajectory, as indicated by the plane of the LMC
orbit (dashed curve). A similar effect is observed in the numerical models that follow the accretion of the LMC onto the MW
(Supplementary Information).
In Fig. 2, we show the probability density function of the magnitude of the disk motion *v* travel derived from each of the studied
tracers. The strongest constraint is provided by the K giant stars,
with [v] travel *;* Kgiants [¼][ 35] � [þ][5] 5 [km s] [�][1] . Being the most numerous bright

tracers in our data sample and having accurate proper motions I
out to large Galactocentric distances (Extended Data Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Information), these stars currently provide the
best kinematic targets of the outermost halo. The full phase-space
information also allows for removal of major substructure in
the halo (Extended Data Fig. 2). BHB stars and satellites return
slightly less constraining measurements of the reflex motion,
v travel *;* BHB ¼ 26 [þ] � [9] 9 [km s] [�][1] and v travel *;* satellites ¼ 55 [þ] � [22] 23 [km s] [�][1], respec
tively. All three datasets are consistent at the 67% confidence level I I
(Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 3). Fitting the combined sample
of BHB and K giant stars yields v travel *;* combined ¼ 32 [þ] �4 [4] [km s] [�][1] . The

substantial reflex motion and location of the apex is consistent with I
a massive LMC falling in for the first time. To test our Bayesian
fitting technique we use mock datasets of the stellar halo drawn
from numerical models of the MW–LMC interaction (Extended
Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Information). The magnitude of
the reflex motion observed in the stellar halo of the MW is con
sistent with numerical models where the infall mass of the LMC
is greater than 10 [11] *M* ⊙ (where *M* ⊙ is the solar mass; see Extended
Data Figs. 5, 6 and 7), which is much larger than the mass enclosed
within its luminous radius, *M* LMC (<8.7 kpc) ≃ 0.17 × 10 [11] *M* ⊙
(ref. [17] ), suggesting that the LMC fell in surrounded by an extended
dark matter halo.
Our results complicate theoretical studies of the MW stellar halo
and firmly indicate that our Galaxy cannot be treated in dynamical equilibrium. In addition, Earth observers must correct for
non-inertial effects introduced by the MW disk motion when translating velocities measured in a heliocentric frame into a coordinate
system whose origin is at the Galactic centre of mass. Although
corrections from the solar reflex are commonly applied, the reflex
motion of the MW disk has so far been neglected in dynamical
studies of distant objects. Failure to properly treat the LMC infall
may bias measurements of various quantities, such as the total mass
of the MW [18] . The measurements presented here, constraining both
the amplitude and direction of travel of the MW disk, will help to

The black-and-white background image is the observed projected density of RR Lyrae stars identified in the union of the Pan-STARRS DR1 and Gaia DR2
catalogues [14][–][16] . The LMC, as well as two less-massive satellites, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr), are labelled.
Comparison with the plane of the LMC orbit derived from its proper motions (dashed white curve) indicates that the MW disk is roughly moving towards
a point along the past trajectory of the LMC across our Galaxy. The Pan-STARRS survey covers only the Northern sky, and thus the region around the LMC
is covered only by Gaia and is thus comparatively undersampled in RR Lyrae stars.



remove non-inertial perspective effects from the kinematics of the
outer stellar halo and the satellite galaxy population.
Previous studies have used similar datasets to those considered
here to measure the rotation pattern and velocity dispersion profile
of the stellar halo [19][,][20], but did not account for the reflex motion of
the MW disk. A recent work [18] finds a net positive *v* *z* motion in a
sample of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies with 6-dimensional
observations. As the LMC is expected to induce the disk to move
downwards, one expects an upward motion in the outer halo.
However, the magnitude and direction of the reflex motion signal
has remained unconstrained so far. In particular, the localization of
the apex signal is only enabled by combining full phase-space information of distant halo tracers (Extended Data Fig. 5).
Our results conclusively show that the kinematics of halo stars
at *r* ≥ 40 kpc are affected by the displacement of the MW disk from
the Galactic barycentre. At smaller radii, the magnitude of reflex
motion diminishes and the kinematic pattern becomes more
dynamically convoluted than a simple dipole as the inner stellar halo
reacts in response to the displacement of the disk potential [9] . Tidal
streams may also be affected by the dislodgement of the MW disk


from the Galactic centre of mass. Intriguingly, current constraints
on the shape of the dark matter halo using tidal streams have so
far reported contradictory values that cover all possible geometries:
from spherical to oblate to prolate to even triaxial shapes [21][–][25] . Given
that the resulting reflex motion varies across the sky (Extended Data
Fig. 8), and that tidal streams can wrap large regions of the Galaxy,
this effect may be an important factor with which to explain the
discrepant measurements.
Current state-of-the-art dynamical-modelling techniques often
compute orbits in gravitational potentials centred at the MW disk
in order to constrain the distribution of matter in our Galaxy. Our
results indicate that an essential next theoretical step is to generate
time-varying MW–LMC potentials where both galaxies are allowed
to deform as a result of their mutual gravitational attraction. Once
self-consistent MW–LMC potentials are developed, a number of
questions arise. What was the structure of the stellar and dark matter haloes prior to the infall of the LMC? What is the exact trajectory
of the LMC since it fell into the MW, and how did the dynamics of
dark matter alter its path? Does the LMC lose its dark matter halo
envelope to tides, and where does the stripped dark matter end up

in our Galaxy? In this context, the detection of the reflex motion
of the MW disk calls for the development of more sophisticated,
self-consistent models that capture non-equilibrium features in the
stellar halo. For example, the LMC is predicted to induce strong
perturbations on the spatial configuration and kinematics of stellar
tracers, such as the formation of a pronounced ‘wake’ in the smooth
stellar halo [8], and to perturb tidal streams out of their orbital planes [5] .
Astronomers must also turn their attention to the dynamics of
the Local Group, a larger volume of galaxies that includes our nearest massive neighbour, Messier 31 (M31, the Andromeda galaxy).
The quadrant that hosts M31 ( *ℓ* < 180°, *b* < 0°) is one of the regions
of the sky most affected by reflex motion, a finding that suggests that
previous studies treating the orbit of M31 will need to be revised in
light of the localized direction of the MW disk displacement with
respect to the Galaxy barycentre.
Our understanding of the MW stellar halo is on the verge of a
golden age owing to data availability and analysis. Upcoming data
releases from the Gaia mission will provide robust proper-motion
measurements out to the most distant regions of the halo. When
coupled with ongoing and future radial velocity surveys (LAMOST [26],
4MOST [27] ) and new instruments (MOONS [28] ), the number of halo
stars with accurate 6-dimensional phase-space measurements could
be potentially increased by a factor of about 100 in the next decade
(Supplementary Information). Such datasets will allow us to measure the radial variation of reflex motion, the infall trajectory of
the LMC and the location of its tidal debris with great detail, which
in turn will constrain the dark matter distribution in both galaxies
with unprecedented accuracy.

**Methods**
**Bayesian inference method.** In this section we describe the fundamentals of a
Bayesian method to search for signatures of reflex motion in the outer stellar halo.
We analyse stars with full phase-space information, that is, heliocentric distances
*D*, Galactocentric coordinates ( *l*, *b* ), line-of-sight velocities *v* los and proper motions
( *μ* *ℓ*, *μ* *b* ). The technique is applied to observational datasets as well as to mock
catalogues of halo stars created from *n* -body realizations of the LMC–MW system
(Supplementary Information).
Our models contain nine free parameters that are fitted simultaneously to
the data. These are the magnitude of the disk velocity, *v* travel, its apex direction
in Galactocentric coordinates ( *ℓ* apex, *b* apex ), the mean velocity of halo stars in **f** **f** **f** **f** **f** **f**
spherical coordinates with origin at the Galactic centre 〈 *v* *r* 〉, 〈 *v* *ϕ* 〉 and 〈 *v* *θ* 〉, plus
three hyperparameters in quadrature to the observational measurement variance in order to minimize *σ* h,los, *σ* *h*, *ℓ* and *σ* *h*, *b*, with units of km s [−][1], which are added
covariance with the rest of model parameters. Hyperparameters provide a
useful tool with which to assign weights to datasets beyond those derived from


statistical errors [29] . Their chief role is to minimize biases arising from (unknown)
model imperfections by increasing the uncertainty associated with the posterior
distributions. These statistical objects effectively act as ‘nuisance’ parameters
with no direct physical meaning, which are fitted to the data to be subsequently
marginalized over the posterior distributions on the quantities of interest.
Our analysis allows for non-zero mean velocities in each degree of freedom,
〈 *v* *r* 〉, 〈 *v* *ϕ* 〉 and 〈 *v* *θ* 〉, as well as a reflex motion of the MW disk owing to the
gravitational pull of the LMC, Δ **v** travel . The motion of the MW disk with respect
to the stellar halo is modelled as a simple dipole. Comparison against live
*n* -body models shows that this analytical model describes the reflex motion
of halo stars at large Galactocentric distances very well [9] . To this aim, we rotate
the Galactocentric reference system in such a way that the new *z* -axis is aligned
with the disk motion, which points in the direction ( *ℓ* apex, *b* apex ). The spherical
azimuthal and polar coordinates of any given star are transformed to the rotated
frame as ( *ϕ*, *θ* ) → ( *ϕ* 1, *ϕ* 2 ). In this frame, the dipole Δ **v** travel ¼ ðΔv r *;* Δv ϕ 1 *;* Δv ϕ 2 Þ
can be simply computed as

The rotation of the Galactocentric axes is done using an Euler– *XYZ* transformation
with angles ( *ϕ*, *θ*, *ψ* ) rot = ( *l* apex, π/2 − *b* apex, 0). Conversion between heliocentric and
Galactocentric frames is done by adopting a right-handed Cartesian coordinate
system where the centre of the MW is at ( *x*, *y*, *z* ) = (0, 0, 0), and the Sun is at
**r** !MW ¼ ð�8 *:* 30 *;* 0 *:* 00 *;* 0 *:* 02Þ kpc (refs. [30][,][31] ). In these coordinates the Sun moves
with a velocity **v** !MW ¼ ð11 *:* 10 *;* 244 *:* 24 *;* 7 *:* 25Þ km s [�][1] (refs. [32][,][33] ). Changes of up
to a few per cent in these quantities do not affect our analysis [34] ; however, *v* travel is
modestly dependent on the choice of the rotation velocity at the solar circle such
that increasing the rotation velocity at the solar circle decreases the magnitude of
the reflex motion, and vice versa.
In a heliocentric coordinate system, the average velocity vector of the stellar
halo can be calculated from the mean velocity components fitted in our analysis
and the reflex motion of the disk as

stream by rotating our reference frame such that the polar angle of stream stars
measured from the Galactic centre is located at *B* sgr = 0 on average [46] . Subsequently,
we identify stars in the orbital plane of the stream by choosing those that fall within
∣ *B* sgr ∣ < 20°, and compute their angular momentum components, **L** ¼ ðL x *;* L y *;* L z Þ .
Next, we draw a sphere with radius 3,000 kpc km s [−][1] around the location of the
Sagittarius dwarf **L** sgr ¼ ð605 *;* �4515 *;* �1267Þ kpc km s [�][1] . Stars that fall in this
region are tagged as Sagittarius members and removed from our sample (Extended
Data Fig. 2). We have checked that the result does not strongly depend on the size
of the sphere. We do not find that any of the stars in our sample belong to known
globular clusters or satellite galaxies, apart from Sagittarius.
We also use the positions, distances, radial velocities, and proper motions
of MW satellites compiled from literature sources [13][,][47][–][52] . To identify possible
LMC satellites we follow a procedure similar to that above to identify Sagittarius
stream members. First, we locate the LMC and the Small Magellanic Cloud
in angular momentum space at **L** LMC ¼ ð�16044 *;* 1236 *;* �1520Þ kpc km s [�][1]
and **L** SMC ¼ ð�15169 *;* �3155 *;* �2827Þ kpc km s [�][1] and define the separation
jΔ **L** MC j j **L** SMC � **L** LMC j ¼ 4 *;* 664 kpc km s [�][1] as a threshold in angular
momentum space. Subsequently, we compute the angular momentum of the rest of
the MW satellites and rank-order them according to their separation with respect
to the LMC, jΔ **L** j ¼ j **L** � **L** LMC j . The first two galaxies in the ranking (Horologium
I and Carina I) have an angular momentum separation jΔ **L** j *<* jΔ **L** MC j, which
establishes a probable association. Consequently, Horologium I and Carina I are
removed from the sample. A third galaxy, Phoenix II, has been recently identified
as a possible satellite of the LMC [50], and indeed appears as the third galaxy in the
ranking with jΔ **L** j jΔ **L** MC j . Accordingly, Phoenix II is also excluded from the
analysis. Following suggestions from the literature of satellites that may be strongly
affected by the LMC, we also removed Carina II, Carina III, Hydrus I, Hydra II,
Draco II, Reticulum II, Sculptor, Tucana III and Segue 1 [5][,][53][,][54] .
Our final datasets consist of *N* Kgiants = 543, *N* BHB = 292 and *N* satellites = 33.
Other stellar tracers, such as RR Lyrae stars, do not have accurate 6-dimensional
information, including those with available radial velocities [14][–][16][,][55] . Distances
for RR Lyrae stars are estimated using an absolute magnitude calibration tuned
for Gaia [56] . Another common halo tracer, the MW globular cluster system, has
6-dimensional information available [57], but only a handful of clusters are currently
located at *r* - 40 kpc (Supplementary Information). We collect these datasets in the
hope that future data-taking projects will expand the usable 6-dimensional stellar
sample with an all-sky coverage. In particular, an all-sky sample of RR Lyrae with
spectroscopic follow-up would provide a particularly rich dataset, for which Gaia
DR3 may return proper motions usable for our analysis beyond about 40 kpc in
the near future.

**Inference code.** We apply a nested-sampling technique [36] to calculate posterior
distributions for our parameters and the evidence of the model. Here, we use
the code MultiNest, a Bayesian inference tool which also produces posterior
samplings and returns error estimates of the evidence [37][,][38] .

**Datasets.** We use available datasets of two luminous stellar tracers at *r* - 40 kpc:
BHB stars [10][,][39], and K giant stars [11][,][40] identified using SDSS/SEGUE photometry
and spectroscopy [41] . We accept the positions, distances, and uncertainties in the
published tables. We apply a colour-cleaning technique to reduce Blue Straggler
contamination in the BHB sample, eliminating stars that fall in the region of colour
space suggested in ref. [42] . We cross-match both the BHB and K giant star catalogs
at 1″ tolerance with Gaia DR2 [12][,][43] to obtain proper motions in right ascension and
declination. We filter the samples by the reduced unit weighted error—a collected
measure of the data quality—accepting only stars for which it is <1.4 (ref. [44] ).
We convert the observed proper motions to Galactocentric coordinates, including
proper motion uncertainty covariance.
While Gaia DR2 has known systematic errors in proper motion for bright
stars ( *G* < 12), the systematics for faint stars do not appear to show any large-scale
structure that would bias our results and can be assumed to be in a non-rotating
frame [44] . We accept the reported mean and root-mean-square all-sky uncertainties
(in milliarcseconds per year: 〈 *μ* RA 〉 = 0. ; *σ* RA = 0.039; 〈 *μ* dec 〉 = 0.011; *σ* dec = 0.037)
and emphasize that the root-mean-square uncertainties are an order of magnitude
smaller than the typical errors on individual sources.
Although the catalogues do not distinguish between disk and halo stars,
we do not expect any disk stars at distances *r* - 40 kpc. Independently of published
distances, we have also checked that BHB and K giant stars in our catalogue have
unresolved Gaia parallaxes, which confirms their location beyond the disk volume.
We also exclude stars with latitudes ∣ *b* ∣ < 10 [∘] to minimize contamination from faint
disk stars misidentified as BHB or K giant stars in the published catalogues.
The resulting catalogue still contains stars whose distances may be highly
overestimated. These objects stand out as stars with very large velocities. In
order to remove contaminants we performed iterative sigma clipping following a
standard procedure: for all stars in the sample, we compute the difference between
model prediction and measurement 〈(data minus model)/ *σ* 〉 *i*, where brackets
denote averages over posterior distributions, and the subindex *i* runs over the three
velocity dimensions: radial velocities and the two proper motion components.
Here, *σ* is the fitted dispersion, which combines individual measurement errors and
the hyperparameters (equations (7) and (10)). Stars with ∣〈(data minus model)/ *σ* 〉 *i* ∣

- 3 in any of those dimensions are considered outliers. After removing them, we
re-fit the new sample. The above steps are iterated until convergence is achieved.
Give that the BHB and K giant star samples are drawn from SEGUE [41], the
sky coverage is not complete. We test the impact of incomplete sky coverage on
our Bayesian inference method using mock catalogues drawn from live *n* -body
simulations within the SEGUE footprint (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6 as well as
Supplementary Information). The results indicate that the limited sky area does
not introduce any meaningful bias. Additionally, we measure the magnitude of
proper motions at *r* - 40 kpc from the K giant star sample, finding that the proper
motions are less than 1 milliarcsecond per year. This provides an estimate of the
precision in proper motions required to studying an ensemble of stars in the MW
halo at *r* - 40 kpc. The canonical velocity of a star in the MW halo, *v* = 250 km
s [−][1], corresponds to a proper motions of *μ* ≈ 1 milliarcsecond per year at 50 kpc
(Extended Data Fig. 1).
Since we model the stellar halo as a smooth object, the presence of kinematic
substructures, such as tidal streams, could potentially bias our results. The
Sagittarius stream is the largest known substructure in the stellar halo of our
Galaxy [45] . We exclude Sagittarius stream stars from our sample on the basis of their
angular momentum coordinates (see Supplementary Information for additional
details). In short, first we identify stars located in the plane of the Sagittarius
