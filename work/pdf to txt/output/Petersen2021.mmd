###### Abstract

The Large Magellanic Cloud is the most massive satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, with an estimated mass exceeding a tenth of the mass of the Milky Way\({}^{\circ}\). Just past its closest approach of about 50 kpc, and flying past the Milky Way at an astonishing speed of 327 km s\({}^{-1}\) (ref. [1]), the Large Magellanic Cloud can affect our Galaxy in a number of ways, including dislodging the Milky Way disk from the Galactic centre of mass\({}^{\circ}\). Here, we report evidence that the Milky Way disk is moving with respect to stellar tracers in the outer halo in a direction that points at an earlier location on the Large Magellanic Cloud trajectory. The resulting reflex motion is detected in the kinematics of outer halo stars and Milky Way satellite galaxies with accurate distances, proper motions and line-of-sight velocities. Our results indicate that dynamical models of our Galaxy cannot neglect gravitational perturbations induced by the Large Magellanic Cloud infall, nor can observations of the stellar halo be treated in a reference frame that does not correct for disk reflex motion. Future spectroscopic surveys of the stellar halo combined with Gaia astrometry will allow for sophisticated modelling of the Large Magellanic Cloud trajectory across the Milky Way, constraining the dark matter distribution in both galaxies with unprecedented detail.

Numerical simulations that follow the accretion of a massive Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) into our Galaxy predict that the Milky Way (MW) disk will be displaced with a speed of \(v_{\rm{med}}\approx v_{\rm{acc}}(M_{\rm{halo}}/M_{\rm{MW}})\) relative to the initial Galactic barycentre\({}^{\circ}\). If true, the disk motion should be detectable in the apparent kinematics of halo stars with long dynamical times as a simple dipole\({}^{\circ}\). The peak of the blue-shifted velocities, or apex, is the direction towards which the MW disk is currently travelling. Here, we measure the direction (\(\ell^{\prime}_{\rm{pero}},b_{\rm{gen}}\)) and the magnitude (\(v_{\rm{med}}\)) of the disk motion by applying a Bayesian analysis of proper motions and radial velocities of hundreds of bright, distant stars in the smooth MW stellar halo: K giants, blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars and the MW satellites, each with individual 6-dimensional position\(-\)velocity information\({}^{\rm{[1-1]}}\). Distant tracers have long dynamical times and are thus slow to react to the gravitational pull of the LMC\({}^{\circ}\). Because the MW disk moves in response to the LMC, but the outer halo does not, a reflex motion arises as a global kinematic pattern on the sky: the distant halo appears to move relative to the MW disk, when in fact it is the MW disk moving relative to the distant halo stars, an effect akin to the apparent motion of rain drops seen from a car driving through a duppour.

In Fig. 1, we show the on-sky probability density function for the direction of the MW disk travel imprinted in the kinematics of each of the three halo tracers (\(\ell_{\rm{pero}},b_{\rm{gen}}\)), against a backdrop of RR Lyrae stars\({}^{\rm{[1-1]}}\). All three tracers return consistent values at the 67% confidence level (Table 1). Strikingly, the apex direction is not pointing towards the present-day location of the LMC on the sky, but rather along its historical trajectory across the MW. This implies that, as the LMC approached its current location with great speed, the MW disk was not able to keep up. As a result, the MW disk appears to be travelling in the direction of the LMC at some earlier point on its trajectory, as indicated by the plane of the LMC orbit (dashed curve). A similar effect is observed in the numerical models that follow the accretion of the LMC onto the MW (Supplementary Information).

In Fig. 2, we show the probability density function of the magnitude of the disk motion \(v_{\rm{med}}\) derived from each of the studied tracers. The strongest constraint is provided by the K giant stars, with \(v_{\rm{med},Kgiants}=35^{+5}_{-5}\) km s\({}^{-1}\). Being the most numerous bright tracers in our data sample and having accurate proper motions out to large Galactocentric distances (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Information), these stars currently provide the best kinematic targets of the outermost halo. The full phase-space information also allows for removal of major substructure in the halo (Extended Data Fig. 2). BHB stars and satellites return slightly less constraining measurements of the reflex motion, \(v_{\rm{trend,BHB}}=26^{+}_{-9}\) km s\({}^{-1}\) and \(v_{\rm{burst,satellites}}=55^{+23}_{-23}\) km s\({}^{-1}\), respectively. All three datasets are consistent at the 67% confidence level (Table 1 and Extended Data Fig. 3). Fitting the combined sample of BHB and K giant stars yields \(v_{\rm{trend,combined}}=32^{+4}_{-4}\) km s\({}^{-1}\). The substantial reflex motion and location of the apex is consistent with a massive LMC falling in for the first time. To test our Bayesian fitting technique we use mock datasets of the stellar halo drawn from numerical models of the MW-LMC interaction (Extended Data Fig. 4 and Supplementary Information). The magnitude of the reflex motion observed in the stellar halo of the MW is consistent with numerical models where the infall mass of the LMC is greater than \(10^{11}M_{\odot}\) (where \(M_{\odot}\) is the solar mass; see Extended Data Figs. 5, 6 and 7), which is much larger than the mass enclosed within its luminous radius, \(M_{\rm{LMC}}(<\)8.7 kpc) \(\simeq 0.17\times 10^{11}M_{\odot}\) (ref. [1]), suggesting that the LMC fell in surrounded by an extended dark matter halo.

Our results complicate theoretical studies of the MW stellar halo and firmly indicate that our Galaxy cannot be treated in dynamical equilibrium. In addition, Earth observes must correct for non-inertial effects introduced by the MW disk motion when translating velocities measured in a heliocentric frame into a coordinate system whose origin is at the Galactic centre of mass. Although corrections from the solar reflex are commonly applied, the reflex motion of the MW disk has so far been neglected in dynamical studies of distant objects. Failure to properly treat the LMC infall may bias measurements of various quantities, such as the total mass of the MW\({}^{\rm{[1-1]}}\). The measurements presented here, constraining both the amplitude and direction of travel of the MW disk, will help toremove non-inertial perspective effects from the kinematics of the outer stellar halo and the satellite galaxy population.

Previous studies have used similar datasets to those considered here to measure the rotation pattern and velocity dispersion profile of the stellar halo [13, 14], but did not account for the reflex motion of the MW disk. A recent work [21] finds a net positive \(v_{*}\) motion in a sample of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies with 6-dimensional observations. As the LMC is expected to induce the disk to move downwards, one expects an upward motion in the outer halo. However, the magnitude and direction of the reflex motion signal has remained unconstrained so far. In particular, the localization of the apex signal is only enabled by combining full phase-space information of distant halo tracers (Extended Data Fig. 5).

Our results conclusively show that the kinematics of halo stars at \(r\)\(\geq\) 40 kpc are affected by the displacement of the MW disk from the Galactic barycentre. At smaller radii, the magnitude of reflex motion diminishes and the kinematic pattern becomes more dynamically convoluted than a simple dipole as the inner stellar halo reacts in response to the displacement of the disk potential [21]. Tidal streams may also be affected by the dislodgement of the MW disk from the Galactic centre of mass. Intriguingly, current constraints on the shape of the dark matter halo using tidal streams have so far reported contradictory values that cover all possible geometries: from spherical to oblate to prolate to even triaxial shapes [21, 22, 23]. Given that the resulting reflex motion varies across the sky (Extended Data Fig. 8), and that tidal streams can wrap large regions of the Galaxy, this effect may be an important factor with which to explain the discrepant measurements.

Current state-of-the-art dynamical-modelling techniques often compute orbits in gravitational potentials centred at the MW disk in order to constrain the distribution of matter in our Galaxy. Our results indicate that an essential next theoretical step is to generate time-varying MW-LMC potentials where both galaxies are allowed to deform as a result of their mutual gravitational attraction. Once self-consistent MW-LMC potentials are developed, a number of questions arise. What was the structure of the stellar and dark matter haloes prior to the infall of the LMC? What is the exact trajectory of the LMC since it fell into the MW, and how did the dynamics of dark matter alter its path? Does the LMC lose its dark matter halo envelope to tides, and where does the stripped dark matter end up

The black-and-white background image is the observed projected density of RR Lyrae stars identified in the union of the Pan-STARRS DRI and Gaia DR2 catalogues [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46]. The LMC, as well as two less-massive satellites, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr), are labelled. Comparison with the plane of the LMC orbit derived from its proper motions (dashed white curve) indicates that the MW disk is roughly moving towards a point along the past trajectory of the LMC across our Galaxy. The Pan-STARRS survey covers only the Northern sky, and thus the region around the LMC is covered only by Gaia and is thus comparatively undersampled in RR Lyrae stars.

in our Galaxy? In this context, the detection of the reflex motion of the MW disk calls for the development of more sophisticated, self-consistent models that capture non-equilibrium features in the stellar halo. For example, the LMC is predicted to induce strong perturbations on the spatial configuration and kinematics of stellar tracers, such as the formation of a pronounced 'wake' in the smooth stellar halo', and to perturb tidal streams out of their orbital planes'.

Astronomers must also turn their attention to the dynamics of the Local Group, a larger volume of galaxies that includes our nearest massive neighbour, Messier 31 (M31, the Andromeda galaxy). The quadrant that hosts M31 (\(\ell^{\prime}\approx 180^{\prime}\), \(b<0^{\prime}\)) is one of the regions of the sky most affected by reflex motion, a finding that suggests that previous studies treating the orbit of M31 will need to be revised in light of the localized direction of the MW disk displacement with respect to the Galaxy barycentre.

Our understanding of the MW stellar halo is on the verge of a golden age owing to data availability and analysis. Upcoming data releases from the Gaia mission will provide robust proper-motion measurements out to the most distant regions of the halo. When coupled with ongoing and future radial velocity surveys (LAMOST\({}^{\rm ss}\), 4MOST\({}^{\rm ss}\)) and new instruments (MOONS\({}^{\rm ss}\)), the number of halo stars with accurate 6-dimensional phase-space measurements could be potentially increased by a factor of about 100 in the next decade (Supplementary Information). Such datasets will allow us to measure the radial variation of reflex motion, the infall trajectory of the LMC and the location of its tidal debris with great detail, which in turn will constrain the dark matter distribution in both galaxies with unprecedented accuracy.

## Methods

### Bayesian inference method

In this section we describe the fundamentals of a Bayesian method to search signatures of reflex motion in the outer stellar halo. We analyse stars with full phase-space information, that is, heliocentric distances \(D\), Galactocentric coordinates (\(l\), \(b\)), line-of-sight velocities \(v_{\rm in}\) and proper motions (\(\mu_{\rm e}\), \(\mu_{\rm B}\)). The technique is applied to observational datasets as well as to mock catalogues of halo stars created from a-body realizations of the LMC-MW system (Supplementary Information).

Our models contain nine free parameters that are fitted simultaneously to the data. These are the magnitude of the disk velocity, \(v_{\rm out}\), its apex direction in Galactocentric coordinates (\(\ell_{\rm apoc}\), \(b_{\rm out}\)), the mean velocity of halo stars in spherical coordinates with origin at the Galactic centre (\(v_{\rm e}\)), \(v_{\rm e}\)) and (\(v_{\rm e}\)), plus three hyperparameters \(\ell_{\rm apoc}\), \(\alpha_{\rm ap}\), and \(\alpha_{\rm ap}\) with units of mass \(v_{\rm in}\), which are added in quadrature to the observational measurement variance in order to minimize covariance with the rest of model parameters. Hyperparameters provide a useful tool with which to assign weights to datasets beyond those derived from statistical errors". Their chief role is to minimize biases arising from (unknown) model imperfections by increasing the uncertainty associated with the posterior distributions. These statistical objects effectively ask as 'usin' parameters with no direct physical meaning, which are fitted to the data to be subsequently marginalized over the posterior distributions on the quantities of interest.

Our analysis allows for non-zero mean velocities in each degree of freedom, (\(v_{\rm e}\)), (\(v_{\rm e}\)) and (\(v_{\rm e}\)), as well as a reflex motion of the MW disk owing to the gravitational pull of the LMC, \(\Delta v_{\rm inrad}\). The motion of the MW disk with respect to the stellar halo is modelled as a simple dipole. Comparison against live \(n\)-body models shows that this analytical model describes the reflex motion of halo stars at large Galactocentric distances very well. To this aim, we rotate the Galactocentric reference system in such a way that the new \(\Sigma\)-axis is aligned with the disk motion, which points in the direction (\(\ell_{\rm apoc}\), \(b_{\rm out}\)). The spherical azimuthal and polar coordinates of any given star are transformed to the rotated frame as \((\phi_{\rm r},\theta)\rightarrow(\phi_{\rm r},\phi_{\rm r})\). In this frame, the dipole \(\Delta v_{\rm inrad}=(\omega_{\rm r},\lambda_{\rm r_{\rm e}},\Delta\varphi_{\rm r _{\rm e}})\) can be simply computed as

\[\Delta v_{\rm r} = -v_{\rm inrad}\cos(\phi_{\rm r})\] \[\Delta v_{\rm r_{\rm e}} = +v_{\rm inrad}\sin(\phi_{\rm r}) \tag{1}\] \[\Delta v_{\rm r_{\rm e}} = 0.\]

The rotation of the Galactocentric axes is done using an Euler-\(XYZ\) transformation with angles \((\phi_{\rm r},\theta)\), \(\psi_{\rm inrad}=(l_{\rm apoc},\pi l^{2}-b_{\rm apoc})\). Conversion between heliocentric and Galactocentric frames is done by adopting a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system where the centre of the MW is at \((x,y,z)=(0,0,0)\), and the Sun is at \(\epsilon_{\rm e-MW}=(-8.30,0.00,0.02)\) kpc (refs. [10]). In these coordinate the Sun moves with velocity \(v_{\rm e-MW}=(11.04,244.4,7.25)\) km s\({}^{-1}\) (refs. [10]). Changes of up to a few per cent in these quantities do not affect our analysis\({}^{\rm ss}\); however, \(v_{\rm inrad}\) is modestly dependent on the choice of the rotation velocity at the solar circle such that increasing the rotation velocity at the solar circle decreases the magnitude of the reflex motion, and vice versa.

In a heliocentric coordinate system, the average velocity vector of the stellar halo can be calculated from the mean velocity components fitted in our analysis and the reflex motion of the disk as

\[\langle{\bf v}\rangle=\Delta v_{\rm inrad}+\langle v_{\rm e}\rangle+\langle v _{\rm e}\rangle+\langle v_{\rm e}\rangle-\mathbf{v}_{\rm c-MW}. \tag{2}\]

The observed components of the vector (2) correspond to the following projections

\[\langle v_{\rm inrad}\rangle = \langle v_{\rm inrad}\rangle+b_{\rm inrad}\] \[\langle\mu_{\rm e}\rangle = \frac{\Delta v_{\rm inrad}}{2b}, \tag{3}\]

where \(b_{\rm inrad}\), \(b_{\rm inrad}\) and \(b_{\rm inrad}\) are unit vectors aligned with the line-of-sight direction and the Galactocentric coordinates (\(\ell,b\)), respectively. We use the conversion from velocity to proper motion

\[v_{\rm r}=kDv_{\rm r}, \tag{4}\]

with a sub-index \(i=\ell,b\) and a geometrical factor \(k=4.74057\) km s\({}^{-1}\) kpc\({}^{-1}\) (milliarcsec/yr\({}^{-1}\)). Here, \(D\) is the heliocentric distance measured in kilogarsecs.

To derive posteriors on the model parameters we adopt a Gaussian likelihood

\[\mathcal{L}([D,\ell_{\rm r},b_{\rm inrad},\mu_{\rm e},\mu_{\rm B}]_{\rm inrad})^{ \rm-N}[{\bf S}]=\prod_{i=1}^{N-\mu_{\rm out}}\rho_{\rm inrad}(\mu_{\rm e},\mu_{ \rm B}); \tag{5}\]

where \({\bf S}=(v_{\rm inrad},\ell_{\rm apoc},b_{\rm out},\langle v_{\rm e}\rangle, \langle v_{\rm e}\rangle,\langle v_{\rm e}\rangle,\alpha_{\rm inrad},\alpha_{ \rm inrad},\alpha_{\rm inrad})\) is a vector that comprises the model parameters. \(\mu_{\rm in}\) is the one-dimensional normal probability function associated with line-of-sight velocities

\[p_{\rm inrad}(\mu_{\rm inrad})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\mu_{\rm inrad}^{2}}}\exp\left[ -\frac{(v_{\rm inrad}-\langle v_{\rm inrad}\rangle)^{2}}{2\sigma_{\rm inrad}^{2}}\right]; \tag{6}\]

with a one-dimensional variance along the line-of-sight direction

\[\sigma_{\rm inrad}^{2}=c_{\rm inrad}^{2}+\sigma_{\rm inrad}^{2}, \tag{7}\]

where \(c_{\rm inrad}\) is the error associated with the line-of-sight velocity, plus the additional Freedomprovided by the hyperparameter \(\sigma_{\rm inrad}\).

The likelihood associated with proper motions is modelled as a bivariate Gaussian,

\[p_{\rm inrad}(\mu_{\rm e},\mu_{\rm B})=\frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{\det(C)}}\exp\left[- \langle x-\langle x\rangle\rangle^{T}C^{-1}\langle x-\langle x\rangle\rangle\right]; \tag{8}\]

where \({\bf z}=(\mu_{\rm e},\mu_{\rm B})\) is the data vector, and \(\langle{\bf z}\rangle=(\langle\mu_{\rm e},\mu_{\rm B}\rangle,\langle\mu_{\rm B}\rangle)\) is the vector containing the systemic proper motions. The covariance matrix, \(C\), contains the correlation between the proper motion errors

Figure 2: Measured velocity of the MW disk with respect to halo stars located at Galactocentric distances \(r>40\) kpc (red and blue curves), the combined sample (silver curve) and satellites (orange curve). We find that the three distinct samples of halo tracers (\(K\) giant stars, BHB stars and satellites) return consistent values within statistical uncertainties.

\[C=\left[\begin{array}{cc}\epsilon_{\ell}^{2}&\epsilon\epsilon_{\ell \lambda}\rho\\ \epsilon\epsilon_{\ell\lambda}\rho&\epsilon_{\kappa}^{2}\end{array}\right] \tag{9}\]

where \(\rho\) and \(\epsilon_{\ell\lambda}\) are correlation coefficients and measurement uncertainties, respectively. The two-dimensional variances in proper motion space (\(\ell^{\prime}_{r,\lambda}\)) can be estimated as

\[\epsilon_{\ell}^{2} = c_{\ell}^{2}+c_{\ell}^{2}|\frac{\alpha_{\ell}}{\alpha\ell}|^{2} +\frac{\alpha_{\ell}^{2}}{\alpha\ell^{2}}=c_{\ell}^{2}+c_{\ell}^{2}|\frac{ \alpha_{\ell}^{2}}{\alpha\ell^{2}}+\frac{\beta_{\ell}^{2}}{\alpha\ell^{2}}\] \[\epsilon_{\kappa}^{2} = c_{\ell}^{2}+c_{\ell}^{2}|\frac{\alpha_{\ell}}{\alpha\ell}|^{2} +\frac{\alpha_{\ell}^{2}}{\alpha\ell^{2}}=c_{\ell}^{2}+c_{\ell}^{2}|\frac{ \alpha_{\ell}^{2}}{\alpha\ell^{2}}+\frac{\alpha_{\ell}^{2}}{\alpha\ell^{2}},\]

which include proper motion (\(c_{\ell,\lambda}\)) as well as distance (\(c_{\ell}\)) errors1. In practice, we find that the variances \(c_{\ell}^{2}\) and \(c_{\ell}^{2}\) are typically dominated by the nuisance parameters \(\sigma_{\kappa}^{\rm th}\), and \(\sigma_{\kappa}^{\rm th}\), respectively. These statistical parameters absorb random motions in the stellar halo, which in general are much higher than the velocities associated with measurement errors.

**Extended data** is available for this paper at [https://doi.org/10.1088/s41550-020-01254-3](https://doi.org/10.1088/s41550-020-01254-3).

**Extended Data Fig. 11 Tracer population properties as a function of distance.****a**, Logarithm of number of sources larger than some Galactocentric radius, \(r\), as a function of Galactocentric radius \(r\) in kiloparsecs. We show the three datasets analysed in this paper in colour (red: K Giants, blue: Blue Horizontal Branch, orange: satellites). We show two explored, but unused, datasets in grey (solid grey: globular clusters, dashed gray: RR lyrae stars). **b**, The mean proper motion error in milliarcseconds per year for the stellar sources (K Giants, Blue Horizontal Branch, RR lyrae), as a function of Galactocentric radius. As the brightest sample, K Giants have the smallest uncertainty. We mark 100, 200, and 300 km s\({}^{-}\), the approximate range of halo velocities, as a dotted black curves.

**Extended Data Fig. 21 Angular momentum components of halo stars at Galactocentric distances \(r>20\) kpc.** Blue and red dots denote BH8 and K giant stars, respectively. The angular momentum of the Sagittarius dwarf is marked with a black dot at \(\mathbf{L_{\rm{H}}}_{\rm{eff}}\) ( in units of kpc \(\rm{\,km\,s^{-1}}\)) \(=(605,-4,515,-1,267)\). For reference, circles mark angular momentum difference \(|\mathbf{L}-\mathbf{L_{\rm{H}}}_{\rm{eff}}|=3,000\) kpc \(\rm{\,km\,s^{-1}}\). Panels **a**-**e** and panels **d**-**f** correspond to stars at \(|\mathbf{B_{\rm{eff}}}|<20\) and \(|\mathbf{B_{\rm{eff}}}|>20\): off the orbital plane of the Sagittarius stream, respectively. We show the mean 1e error bar at \(r>40\) kpc in the lower left of the centre column.

**Extended Data Fig. 5 1****Apex direction measured from mock samples of K Giant stars located at \(\gamma\) - 40 kpc in the SDSS footprint.** We use live Galaxy models that experience the infall of LMC-like galaxies with masses \(M_{\rm{auc}}/10^{\rm{h}}M_{\odot}=1,2\) and 3 (panels **a, b** and **c** respectively). Solid lines denote the infall trajectory of the LMC derived from backwards orbit integration of HST proper motions, while dashed lines show models where the LMC trajectory has been flipped. Red (blue) symbols denote the measurement for mock samples with an LMC-like (flipped) trajectory. Uncertainties are the standard deviation derived from the posteriors of the fit locations. Open circles show the point on the trajectory where the LMC crossed the virial radius of the Galaxy. Note that within statistical uncertainties the apex direction derived from the kinematics of distant stellar halo particles points towards the direction where the MW disk is currently moving (crossed circles). The disk component is currently travelling to an earlier point on the LMC trajectory.

**Extended Data Fig. 7 | Dynamical time of particles in the model MW-LMC systems as a function of Galactocentric radius.** For ease of reference, horizontal dashed lines show the lookback time for the onset of disk motion. Halo particles with a dynamical time above the horizontal lines react impulsively to the LMC infall. At a fixed radius, radial and circular orbits provide the shortest and longest periods, respectively. As a function of radius, a star's period will fall in the grey-shaded region.
