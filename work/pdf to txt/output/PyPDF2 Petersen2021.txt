galaxy of the Milky Way, with an estimated mass exceeding 
a tenth of the mass of the Milky Way1–5. Just past its closest 
approach of about 50 kpc, and flying past the Milky Way at an astonishing speed of 327 km s
−1 (ref. 6), the Large Magellanic 
Cloud can affect our Galaxy in a number of ways, including dis-lodging the Milky Way disk from the Galactic centre of mass
7–
9. Here, we report evidence that the Milky Way disk is moving 
with respect to stellar tracers in the outer halo in a direction that points at an earlier location on the Large Magellanic 
Cloud trajectory. The resulting reflex motion is detected in the kinematics of outer halo stars and Milky Way satellite galax -
ies with accurate distances, proper motions and line-of-sight velocities. Our results indicate that dynamical models of our Galaxy cannot neglect gravitational perturbations induced 
by the Large Magellanic Cloud infall, nor can observations of 
the stellar halo be treated in a reference frame that does not correct for disk reflex motion. Future spectroscopic surveys of the stellar halo combined with Gaia astrometry will allow for 
sophisticated modelling of the Large Magellanic Cloud trajec-
tory across the Milky Way, constraining the dark matter dis-tribution in both galaxies with unprecedented detail.
Numerical simulations that follow the accretion of a massive 
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) into our Galaxy predict that the 
Milky Way (MW) disk will be displaced with a speed of vtravel ≈ 
vLMC(MLMC/MMW) relative to the initial Galactic barycentre7–9. If true, 
the disk motion should be detectable in the apparent kinematics of halo stars with long dynamical times as a simple dipole
9. The peak 
of the blue-shifted velocities, or apex, is the direction towards which the MW disk is currently travelling. Here, we measure the direction 
(ℓ
apex, bapex) and the magnitude (vtravel) of the disk motion by apply -

hundreds of bright, distant stars in the smooth MW stellar halo: K giants, blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars and the MW satellites,

tion10–13. Distant tracers have long dynamical times and are thus 
slow to react to the gravitational pull of the LMC9. Because the MW 
disk moves in response to the LMC, but the outer halo does not, a 
reflex motion arises as a global kinematic pattern on the sky: the 
distant halo appears to move relative to the MW disk, when in fact 
it is the MW disk moving relative to the distant halo stars, an effect akin to the apparent motion of rain drops seen from a car driving through a downpour.
In Fig. 1 , we show the on-sky probability density function for 
the direction of the MW disk travel imprinted in the kinematics of each of the three halo tracers (ℓ
apex, bapex), against a backdrop 
of RR Lyrae stars14–16. All three tracers return consistent values at 
the 67% confidence level (Table 1 ). Strikingly, the apex direction is not pointing towards the present-day location of the LMC on the sky, but rather along its historical trajectory across the MW . This implies that, as the LMC approached its current location with great speed, the MW disk was not able to keep up. As a result, the MW 
disk appears to be travelling in the direction of the LMC at some 
earlier point on its trajectory, as indicated by the plane of the LMC orbit (dashed curve). A similar effect is observed in the numeri

Previous studies have used similar datasets to those considered 
here to measure the rotation pattern and velocity dispersion profile of the stellar halo
19,20, but did not account for the reflex motion of 
the MW disk. A recent work18 finds a net positive vz motion in a 
sample of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies with 6-dimensional observations. As the LMC is expected to induce the disk to move 
downwards, one expects an upward motion in the outer halo. 
However, the magnitude and direction of the reflex motion signal has remained unconstrained so far. In particular, the localization of the apex signal is only enabled by combining full phase-space infor

mation of distant halo tracers (Extended Data Fig. 5).
Our results conclusively show that the kinematics of halo stars 
at r ≥ 40 kpc are affected by the displacement of the MW disk from 
the Galactic barycentre. At smaller radii, the magnitude of reflex motion diminishes and the kinematic pattern becomes more dynamically convoluted than a simple dipole as the inner stellar halo reacts in response to the displacement of the disk potential
9. Tidal 
streams may also be affected by the dislodgement of the MW disk from the Galactic centre of mass. Intriguingly, current constraints on the shape of the dark matter halo using tidal streams have so far reported contradictory values that cover all possible geometries: 
from spherical to oblate to prolate to even triaxial shapes
21–25. Given 
that the resulting reflex motion varies across the sky (Extended Data 
Fig. 8), and that tidal streams can wrap large regions of the Galaxy, 
this effect may be an important factor with which to explain the 
discrepant measurements.
Current state-of-the-art dynamical-modelling techniques often 
compute orbits in gravitational potentials centred at the MW disk 
in order to constrain the distribution of matter in our Galaxy. Our 
results indicate that an essential next theoretical step is to generate time-varying MW–LMC potentials where both galaxies are allowed to deform as a result of their mutual gravitational attraction. Once self-consistent MW–LMC potentials are developed, a number of 
questions arise. What was the structure of the stellar and dark mat

Comparison with the plane of the LMC orbit derived from its proper motions (dashed white curve) indicates that the MW disk is roughly moving towards a point along the past trajectory of the LMC across our Galaxy. The Pan-STARRS survey covers only the Northern sky, and thus the region around the LMC is covered only by Gaia and is thus comparatively undersampled in RR Lyrae stars.

of the MW disk calls for the development of more sophisticated, self-consistent models that capture non-equilibrium features in the 
stellar halo. For example, the LMC is predicted to induce strong 
perturbations on the spatial configuration and kinematics of stellar tracers, such as the formation of a pronounced ‘wake’ in the smooth stellar halo
8, and to perturb tidal streams out of their orbital planes5.
Astronomers must also turn their attention to the dynamics of 
the Local Group, a larger volume of galaxies that includes our near -
est massive neighbour, Messier 31 (M31, the Andromeda galaxy). The quadrant that hosts M31 (ℓ < 180°, b < 0°) is one of the regions 
of the sky most affected by reflex motion, a finding that suggests that 
previous studies treating the orbit of M31 will need to be revised in 
light of the localized direction of the MW disk displacement with respect to the Galaxy barycentre.
Our understanding of the MW stellar halo is on the verge of a 
golden age owing to data availability and analysis. Upcoming data releases from the Gaia mission will provide robust proper-motion measurements out to the most distant regions of the halo. When coupled with ongoing and future radial velocity surveys (LAMOST
26, 
4MOST27) and new instruments (MOONS28), the number of halo 
stars with accurate 6-dimensional phase-space measurements could be potentially increased by a factor of about 100 in the next decade 
(Supplementary Information). Such datasets will allow us to mea
-
sure the radial variation of reflex motion, the infall trajectory of 
the LMC and the location of its tidal debris with great detail, which in turn will constrain the dark matter distribution in both galaxies 
with unprecedented accuracy.
Methods
Bayesian inference method. In this section we describe the fundamentals of a 
Bayesian method to search for signatures of reflex motion in the outer stellar halo. We analyse stars with full phase-space information, that is, heliocentric distances D, Galactocentric coordinates (l, b), line-of-sight velocities v
los and proper motions 
(μℓ, μb). The technique is applied to observational datasets as well as to mock 
catalogues of halo stars created from n-body realizations of the LMC–MW system (Supplementary Information).
Our models contain nine free parameters that are fitted simultaneously to 
the data. These are the magnitude of the disk velocity, v
travel, its apex direction 
in Galactocentric coordinates (ℓapex, bapex), the mean velocity of halo stars in 
spherical coordinates with origin at the Galactic centre 〈vr〉, 〈vϕ〉 and 〈vθ〉, plus 
three hyperparameters σh,los, σh,ℓ and σh,b, with units of km s−1, which are added 
in quadrature to the observational measurement variance in order to minimize 
covariance with the rest of model parameters. Hyperparameters provide a 
useful tool with which to assign weights to datasets beyond those derived from statistical errors29. Their chief role is to minimize biases arising from (unknown) 
model imperfections by increasing the uncertainty associated with the posterior distributions. These statistical objects effectively act as ‘nuisance’ parameters with no direct physical meaning, which are fitted to the data to be subsequently marginalized over the posterior distributions on the quantities of interest.
Our analysis allows for non-zero mean velocities in each degree of freedom, 
〈v
r〉, 〈vϕ〉 and 〈 vθ〉, as well as a reflex motion of the MW disk owing to the 
gravitational pull of the LMC, Δv travel
I. The motion of the MW disk with respect 
to the stellar halo is modelled as a simple dipole. Comparison against live n-body models shows that this analytical model describes the reflex motion 
of halo stars at large Galactocentric distances very well
9. To this aim, we rotate 
the Galactocentric reference system in such a way that the new z -axis is aligned 
with the disk motion, which points in the direction (ℓapex, bapex). The spherical 
azimuthal and polar coordinates of any given star are transformed to the rotated frame as (ϕ , θ) → (ϕ
1, ϕ2). In this frame, the dipole Δvtravel¼ðΔv r;Δvϕ1;Δvϕ2Þ

The rotation of the Galactocentric axes is done using an Euler–XYZ  transformation 
with angles (ϕ , θ, ψ)rot = (lapex, π/2 − bapex, 0). Conversion between heliocentric and 
Galactocentric frames is done by adopting a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system where the centre of the MW is at (x , y, z) = (0, 0, 0), and the Sun is at

I (refs. 32,33). Changes of up 
to a few per cent in these quantities do not affect our analysis34; however, vtravel is 
modestly dependent on the choice of the rotation velocity at the solar circle such that increasing the rotation velocity at the solar circle decreases the magnitude of the reflex motion, and vice versa.
In a heliocentric coordinate system, the average velocity vector of the stellar 
halo can be calculated from the mean velocity components fitted in our analysis and the reflex motion of the disk as

priors for σh,los, σh,ℓ and σh,b, with ranges that include reasonable parameter values.
See Extended Data Fig. 3 for full covariances between the nine fitting

Inference code. We apply a nested-sampling technique36 to calculate posterior 
distributions for our parameters and the evidence of the model. Here, we use 
the code MultiNest , a Bayesian inference tool which also produces posterior 
samplings and returns error estimates of the evidence37,38.
Datasets. We use available datasets of two luminous stellar tracers at r > 40 kpc: 
BHB stars10,39, and K giant stars11,40 identified using SDSS/SEGUE photometry 
and spectroscopy41. We accept the positions, distances, and uncertainties in the 
published tables. We apply a colour-cleaning technique to reduce Blue Straggler contamination in the BHB sample, eliminating stars that fall in the region of colour space suggested in ref. 
42. We cross-match both the BHB and K giant star catalogs 
at 1″ tolerance with Gaia DR212,43 to obtain proper motions in right ascension and 
declination. We filter the samples by the reduced unit weighted error—a collected measure of the data quality—accepting only stars for which it is <1.4 (ref. 
44).  
We convert the observed proper motions to Galactocentric coordinates, including proper motion uncertainty covariance.
While Gaia DR2 has known systematic errors in proper motion for bright 
stars ( G < 12), the systematics for faint stars do not appear to show any large-scale 
structure that would bias our results and can be assumed to be in a non-rotating frame
44. We accept the reported mean and root-mean-square all-sky uncertainties 
(in milliarcseconds per year: 〈μRA〉 = 0. ; σRA = 0.039; 〈μdec〉 = 0.011; σdec = 0.037) 
and emphasize that the root-mean-square uncertainties are an order of magnitude smaller than the typical errors on individual sources.
Although the catalogues do not distinguish between disk and halo stars,  
we do not expect any disk stars at distances r > 40 kpc. Independently of published distances, we have also checked that BHB and K giant stars in our catalogue have unresolved Gaia parallaxes, which confirms their location beyond the disk volume. We also exclude stars with latitudes ∣b∣ < 10
∘ to minimize contamination from faint 
disk stars misidentified as BHB or K giant stars in the published catalogues.
The resulting catalogue still contains stars whose distances may be highly 
overestimated. These objects stand out as stars with very large velocities. In order to remove contaminants we performed iterative sigma clipping following a standard procedure: for all stars in the sample, we compute the difference between model prediction and measurement 〈(data minus model)/σ〉
i, where brackets 
denote averages over posterior distributions, and the subindex i runs over the three velocity dimensions: radial velocities and the two proper motion components. Here, σ is the fitted dispersion, which combines individual measurement errors and 
the hyperparameters (equations (7) and (10)). Stars with ∣〈(data minus model)/σ〉
i∣ 
> 3 in any of those dimensions are considered outliers. After removing them, we re-fit the new sample. The above steps are iterated until convergence is achieved.
Give that the BHB and K giant star samples are drawn from SEGUE
41, the 
sky coverage is not complete. We test the impact of incomplete sky coverage on 
our Bayesian inference method using mock catalogues drawn from live n-body 
simulations within the SEGUE footprint (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6 as well as Supplementary Information). The results indicate that the limited sky area does not introduce any meaningful bias. Additionally, we measure the magnitude of proper motions at r > 40 kpc from the K giant star sample, finding that the proper motions are less than 1 milliarcsecond per year. This provides an estimate of the precision in proper motions required to studying an ensemble of stars in the MW halo at r > 40 kpc. The canonical velocity of a star in the MW halo, v = 250 km s
−1, corresponds to a proper motions of μ ≈ 1 milliarcsecond per year at 50 kpc 
(Extended Data Fig. 1).
Since we model the stellar halo as a smooth object, the presence of kinematic 
substructures, such as tidal streams, could potentially bias our results. The Sagittarius stream is the largest known substructure in the stellar halo of our Galaxy
45. We exclude Sagittarius stream stars from our sample on the basis of their 
angular momentum coordinates (see Supplementary Information for additional details). In short, first we identify stars located in the plane of the Sagittarius stream by rotating our reference frame such that the polar angle of stream stars 
measured from the Galactic centre is located at B
sgr = 0 on average46. Subsequently, 
we identify stars in the orbital plane of the stream by choosing those that fall within ∣B
sgr∣ < 20°, and compute their angular momentum components, L¼ðLx;Ly;LzÞ
I. 
Next, we draw a sphere with radius 3,000 kpc km s−1 around the location of the 
Sagittarius dwarf Lsgr¼ð605;�4515; �1267Þkpc km s�1
I. Stars that fall in this 
region are tagged as Sagittarius members and removed from our sample (Extended 
Data Fig. 2). We have checked that the result does not strongly depend on the size of the sphere. We do not find that any of the stars in our sample belong to known globular clusters or satellite galaxies, apart from Sagittarius.
We also use the positions, distances, radial velocities, and proper motions 
of MW satellites compiled from literature sources
13,47–52. To identify possible 
LMC satellites we follow a procedure similar to that above to identify Sagittarius 
stream members. First, we locate the LMC and the Small Magellanic Cloud 
in angular momentum space at LLMC¼ ð�16044; 1236; �1520Þ kpc km s�1
I 
and LSMC¼ ð�15169 ;�3155 ;�2827Þ kpc km s�1
I and define the separation 
jΔLMCjjLSMC�LLMCj¼4;664 kpc km s�1
I as a threshold in angular 
momentum space. Subsequently, we compute the angular momentum of the rest of 
the MW satellites and rank-order them according to their separation with respect 
to the LMC, jΔLj¼jL�LLMCj
I. The first two galaxies in the ranking (Horologium 
I and Carina I) have an angular momentum separation jΔL j<jΔLMC j
I, which 
establishes a probable association. Consequently, Horologium I and Carina I are removed from the sample. A third galaxy, Phoenix II, has been recently identified as a possible satellite of the LMC
50, and indeed appears as the third galaxy in the 
ranking with jΔLjj ΔLMCj
I. Accordingly, Phoenix II is also excluded from the 
analysis. Following suggestions from the literature of satellites that may be strongly affected by the LMC, we also removed Carina II, Carina III, Hydrus I, Hydra II, Draco II, Reticulum II, Sculptor, Tucana III and Segue 1
5,53,54.
Our final datasets consist of NKgiants  = 543, NBHB = 292 and Nsatellites  = 33. 
Other stellar tracers, such as RR Lyrae stars, do not have accurate 6-dimensional information, including those with available radial velocities
14–16,55. Distances 
for RR Lyrae stars are estimated using an absolute magnitude calibration tuned for Gaia
56. Another common halo tracer, the MW globular cluster system, has 
6-dimensional information available57, but only a handful of clusters are currently 
located at r  > 40 kpc (Supplementary Information). We collect these datasets in the 
hope that future data-taking projects will expand the usable 6-dimensional stellar sample with an all-sky coverage. In particular, an all-sky sample of RR Lyrae with spectroscopic follow-up would provide a particularly rich dataset, for which Gaia DR3 may return proper motions usable for our analysis beyond about 40 kpc in  
the near future.

Extended Data Fig. 1 | t racer population properties as a function of distance. a, Logarithm of number of sources larger than some Galactocentric radius, 
r, as a function of Galactocentric radius r in kiloparsecs. We show the three datasets analysed in this paper in colour (red: K Giants, blue: Blue horizontal 
Branch, orange: satellites). We show two explored, but unused, datasets in grey (solid grey: globular clusters, dashed gray: RR Lyrae stars). b, The mean proper motion error in milliarcseconds per year for the stellar sources (K Giants, Blue horizontal Branch, RR Lyrae), as a function of Galactocentric radius. As the brightest sample, K Giants have the smallest uncertainty. We mark 100, 200, and 300 km s
−1, the approximate range of halo velocities, as a dotted 
black curves.

Extended Data Fig. 3 | Corner plot of covariance in the nine fitting parameters for the Blue Horizontal Branch (blue), K Giant (red), satellite (orange) 
and combined K Giant+Blue Horizontal Branch samples (silver). The fit parameters are disk velocity, vtravel; Galactocentric longitude apex ℓapex; 
Galactocentric latitude apex bapex; the mean velocity of halo stars in spherical coordinates 〈vr〉, 〈vϕ〉 and 〈vθ〉; the three hyperparameters σh,los, σh,ℓ  
and σh,b. A full description of the model may be found in the Supplementary Information.

Extended Data Fig. 4 | Corner plot for mock datasets of K Giant stars at r > 40 kpc drawn from live n-body simulations of the MW where the LMC falls 
in with a mass MLMC/(1011M⊙) = 1, 2 and 3. Posteriors from the fits for the three models are shown in greyscale from dark to light to indicate increasing 
mass: 1 × 1011M⊙ (black), 2 × 1011M⊙ (dark grey), 3 × 1011M⊙ (light grey). See Supplementary Information for mock data details. All parameters are well 
constrained and show a relatively minor covariance. Note that the bounds on the apex direction and the magnitude of the reflex motion improve in proportion to the LMC mass. Values derived directly from the simulation are shown as dashed vertical lines (on histograms), or coloured ‘x’ markers on contour plots: light red (1 × 10
11M⊙), red (2 × 1011M⊙), dark red (3 × 1011M⊙).

Extended Data Fig. 5 | apex direction measured from mock samples of K Giant stars located at r > 40 kpc in the SDSS footprint. We use live Galaxy 
models that experience the infall of LMC-like galaxies with masses MLMC/1011M⊙ = 1, 2 and 3 (panels a, b and c respectively). Solid lines denote the 
infall trajectory of the LMC derived from backwards orbit integration of hST proper motions, while dashed lines show models where the LMC trajectory has been flipped. Red (blue) symbols denote the measurement for mock samples with an LMC-like (flipped) trajectory. Uncertainties are the standard deviation derived from the posteriors of the fit locations. Open circles show the point on the trajectory where the LMC crossed the virial radius of the Galaxy. Note that within statistical uncertainties the apex direction derived from the kinematics of distant stellar halo particles points towards the direction where the MW disk is currently moving (crossed circles). The disk component is currently travelling to an earlier point on the LMC trajectory.

Extended Data Fig. 6 | Velocity of the Galactic disk (vtravel) inferred from the kinematics of stellar tracers located at r > 40 kpc as a function of LMC 
mass. The solid (dashed) lines show the true speed of the disk barycentre relative to dark matter particles within a radial range 40 < r < 150 on the infall 
(flipped) trajectories in the mock LMC models, where radius r is in kiloparsecs. The blue (red) symbols show the value of vtravel measured from the mock 
models in the infall (flipped) trajectory case.

Extended Data Fig. 7 | Dynamical time of particles in the model MW-LMC systems as a function of Galactocentric radius. For ease of reference, 
horizontal dashed lines show the lookback time for the onset of disk motion. halo particles with a dynamical time above the horizontal lines react impulsively to the LMC infall. At a fixed radius, radial and circular orbits provide the shortest and longest periods, respectively. As a function of radius,  a star’s period will fall in the grey-shaded region.
